                <p>A healthy diet is a diet that helps maintain or improve overall health. A healthy diet provides the
                    body
                    with essential
                    nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate food energy.A healthy diet may
                    contain
                    fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food or
                    sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based
                    and
                    animal-based
                    foods, although a non-plant source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet.
                    Various
                    nutrition guides
                    are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be
                    eating to be
                    healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose
                    between foods based on
                    the components relevant to health.</p>

                <p>Eating a healthy, balanced diet doesn't need to be complicated—or restrictive. Start by choosing a
                    variety of foods from all the major food groups, including fruits and vegetables, lean proteins,
                    dairy products, grains
                    and cereals, and good oils and fats.Cutting back on less nutritious, higher fat, processed foods
                    (there's no need to eliminate treats
                    completely) can help you maintain a healthy weight—and is better for your heart and body in general.
                    Here are 10 key
                    reasons why striving for a healthier diet is worth it.

                <p>Nitrates: Processed foods contain a large amount of nitrates. Nitrates are used mostly in meats like
                    cold cuts to keep
                    them from growing bacteria or losing aesthetic appeal. In the 1970's, the USDA attempted to ban
                    nitrates. Some
                    organizations, like the Organic Consumer's Association, site studies that show increased occurrences
                    of cancer in those
                    who consume too many nitrate-containing meats.Fat: Most processed food contains a lot of fat. This
                    is generally saturated fat, which can increase LDL cholesterol.
                    Sugar: Processed foods are also generally high in sugars, which can make them very high in calories.
                    Salt: Salt (or sodium) is used as a preservative in foods and can increase blood pressure and cause
                    bloating.
                    Vitamins: Processed foods are not known for their healthfulness and many are bereft of vitamins.
